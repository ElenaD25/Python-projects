<h1>Coffee Shop Data Analysis Project</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
 â˜• Welcome to my Coffee Shop Data Analysis project! This project involves analyzing a dataset from a coffee shop to uncover insights and trends that can help improve business decisions. 
  The primary goal is to use data analysis and visualization techniques to better understand customer behavior, sales performance, and operational efficiency within the coffee shop.
</p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>The project utilizes the following tools and technologies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis.</li>
<li>Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.</li>
<li>Matplotlib, Seaborn, Squarify: For data visualization.</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and presenting the analysis.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>

This part consisted of:

1. **Identifying and Handling NULL Values**: 
   - Identified NULL values in the dataset, but there weren't any to handle.

2. **Identifying and Removing Duplicates**: 
   - Searched for duplicate entries, but there weren't any to remove.

3. **Converting Data Types**:
   - Checked the data types of each column and converted them to the correct types where necessary.

4. **Removing Unnecessary Columns**: 
   - Dropped columns that didn't impact the analysis or those I wanted to calculate manually.

5. **Renaming Columns**:
   - Renamed columns to improve the understanding of the dataset.
